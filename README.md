photopage-template
==================

A clean and responsive html5 photo page template using [lightbox 2](http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/?u=9)

This project includes all javascript files from the time of the project creation in the assets folder.

For optimal results, create thumbnails of your images that are no larger than 150px horizontally or vertically, and "full-size" images that are no larger than 1024px. Save the thumbnails in the img/thumbs folder and the full size in img/full.

_Please delete my sample photos and use your own._

To create different sets of photos on your single page, use the data tag:

    data-lightbox="photos"

Use a different variable for the next group.
